Remember to use Firefox browser to run index.html on activity_2 folder. Firefox render very well JavaScript alert and prompt box. I am sure you will like interface and say awesome! like one of person who evaluate this assignment.


One of the feedback from one person who evaluated this assignment says " Programme doesn't display added names HTML interface is awesome! " . Just look activity_Results.pdf to see this feedback.

What i have understood from this guy, want me to alert when names are added, like notification when name added pop up notification show new name is already added to the list. To solve this i have decided to develop a separate branch that add that nofication feature when names are added and finaly i will merge that branch. 
So second branch you will see will be of this feature. 

console.log (" SHARING IS CARING ") ;

alert( " LET ME ALSO MAKE THE THE WORLD BETTER PLACE. ") ;
